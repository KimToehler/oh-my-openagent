# Harness findings log

**Purpose:** a running, append-only record of harness defects, footguns, and surprising
behaviours discovered *while doing real work in other repositories*. This is the place
those observations land so they are not lost in a session transcript.

**Audience:** OMO maintainers. This file is diagnostic, not user-facing — internal jargon
is fine here.

**This is not a bug tracker.** Entries are field observations with evidence. Some become
issues or fixes; some are resolved by documentation; some turn out to be user error and
are kept anyway, because "an agent reliably misreads X" is itself a harness finding.

## How to use this file

Append a new entry when you hit harness behaviour that cost you time, made you guess, or
would mislead the next agent. One entry per distinct finding. Do not rewrite or delete
existing entries — correct them by appending a `**Update:**` line, so the history of what
we believed and when stays intact.

Keep entries short. Evidence over prose: the exact log line, the exact status output, the
file:line. A finding nobody can reproduce is a rumour.

## Severity guide

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `blocker` | Work cannot proceed; no workaround found without intervention. |
| `costly` | Recoverable, but burned real time or tokens (repeated runs, lost sessions, re-work). |
| `papercut` | Small friction; correct behaviour eventually, annoying path there. |
| `docs-gap` | Harness behaved correctly, but the docs/instructions led the agent to the wrong conclusion. |

# Findings

## 2026-08-17 — Detached `ctx_shell` jobs never notify, and silently strand agent sessions

**Severity:** blocker
**Area:** background tasks
**Observed in:** `~/git/onara`, during a 27-todo parallel implementation plan

**What happened:** `ctx_shell(run_in_background=true)` returns a `shell_*` job id whose
completion is **pull-only** — nothing ever pushes a notification. Agents that fired a long
gradle build, ended their turn, and waited to be woken were never woken. Five subagent
sessions died this way in one work session; each time the detached job ran to completion
and wrote results to disk with no agent left to read them. Work sat uncommitted in a dirty
worktree for ~2.5h before a human noticed.

The trap is the spelling collision: `task(run_in_background=true)` **does** notify;
`ctx_shell(run_in_background=true)` **never** does.

**Evidence:** source read at `~/git/lean-ctx` (v3.9.18):

- job registry is in-process memory only —
  `rust/src/server/background_shell.rs:35` (`static JOBS: LazyLock<Mutex<HashMap<String, Job>>>`)
- completion detected by the worker thread at `background_shell.rs:141-166`; emits nothing
- the server *can* send MCP notifications, but only two exist —
  `rust/src/server/notifications.rs:7-23` (`resources/updated`, `tools/list_changed`)
- no disk-backed registry, socket, or DB — nothing external can watch job state
- docs are consistent about it: `rust/LEAN-CTX.md:46` says "then poll job_id"

**Root cause:** by design in lean-ctx; there is no configurable notify-on-completion path.
Confirmed absent, not merely undocumented.

**Workaround:** run the command in the **foreground** (~110s cap covers most builds), or
use ONE bounded loop that breaks on completion and stay inside that call:

```bash
(./gradlew … > /tmp/j.log 2>&1; echo $? > /tmp/j.rc) &
for i in $(seq 1 90); do [ -f /tmp/j.rc ] && break; sleep 2; done; cat /tmp/j.rc
```

**Fix status:** worked around. Options if we want a real fix: (1) caller-side command
composition (`build.sh; on-done.sh` — lean-ctx runs raw shell text, so this needs no
patch); (2) patch lean-ctx to emit a new MCP notification from the completion path and
wire client subscription; (3) make OMO's own `<unpolled-background-shell-jobs>` hook
reliable — see the next entry.

## 2026-08-17 — `<unpolled-background-shell-jobs>` hook fires once, then stops

**Severity:** costly
**Area:** background tasks
**Observed in:** `~/git/onara`

**What happened:** OMO already has a rescue for the trap above — a hook that warns when a
turn ends with a detached job outstanding. It fired once, the agent recovered and worked
for ~35s, then relapsed into the same detach-and-yield pattern. The hook did **not** fire
the second time, and the session was stranded again.

**Evidence:** hook message in the child transcript reported the job as
`shell_442363fc607eed99 — (started before it was tracked)`. Agent woke at 13:32:25, made
three tool calls, went silent at 13:32:59. Files kept landing at 14:49–14:51 with no agent
alive.

**Root cause / hypothesis:** unconfirmed. Either the hook is one-shot per job, or the turn
ended without a *tracked* outstanding job while gradle was still running — the tracking gap
the hook's own message admits to (`started before it was tracked`).

**Workaround:** none automatic; the parent had to notice and resume the lane manually.

**Fix status:** unfixed — needs investigation of the hook's trigger condition and the
tracking gap.

## 2026-08-17 — Stale-cancellation timer misread as a wall-clock budget

**Severity:** docs-gap
**Area:** subagents
**Observed in:** `~/git/onara`

**What happened:** a subagent reported blocked at 8m35s with "lane time expired", having
completed ~80% of its task. No such limit exists. It had read the instruction that idle
subagents are stale-cancelled at 15 min and converted a *liveness* deadline into a *time
budget*, then parked to protect uncommitted work from a cancellation that was never coming.

**Evidence:** global `AGENTS.md:116` warned "idle until stale-cancellation at 15 min,
work uncommitted", backed by a real setting — `staleTimeoutMs: 900000` in
`~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.json:28`.

**Root cause:** the timer is real, but it measures **inactivity** and every tool call
resets it. The instruction stated the hazard without stating the escape, so an agent asking
"am I about to be cancelled?" had no reassuring answer available.

**Workaround / fix:** added an explicit clause to global `AGENTS.md`: stale-cancellation is
an inactivity timer, not a time budget; a polling agent is never at risk; there is no
wall-clock limit on a task, lane, or session; "out of time" is never a valid block reason.

**Fix status:** fixed in the user's global `AGENTS.md` (untracked config). Consider
carrying the same wording into the shipped instructions template so every install gets it.

## 2026-08-17 — Dead task reports `running`; resume requires cancel first

**Severity:** costly
**Area:** background tasks
**Observed in:** `~/git/onara`

**What happened:** after a subagent session died, `background_output` continued reporting
`Status: running` with a frozen duration counter (e.g. stuck at 18m35s while 40+ min of
wall-clock passed). Attempting `task(task_id=…)` to resume failed with
`Task … is currently running and cannot accept a continuation prompt`. The task had to be
explicitly cancelled first, then resumed.

**Evidence:**
```
Error: Task bg_2ce3fa6b is currently running and cannot accept a continuation prompt.
    at resume (…/oh-my-openagent/dist/index.js:141058:22)
```
Independently: last child tool call 12:54, files on disk written 14:49–14:51, no process
alive.

**Root cause / hypothesis:** the in-memory task record is not reconciled against actual
child liveness, so a dead child stays `running` forever.

**Workaround:** verify liveness from **disk** (file mtimes, `git status`, test-result
timestamps) rather than trusting the status line; then
`background_cancel(taskId=…)` followed by `task(task_id=…)` to resume with context intact.

**Fix status:** unfixed.

## 2026-08-17 — Provider outage drops the in-memory task record; sessions unrecoverable by `task_id`

**Severity:** costly
**Area:** background tasks
**Observed in:** `~/git/onara`

**What happened:** after a provider outage and runtime restart, resuming a lane by session
id failed permanently — the runtime that owned the record was gone. The child session's
*work* was intact on disk, but its conversation context could not be resumed.

**Evidence:**
```
Error: Task not found for session: ses_ff0451424ffeWr7FTI4zAUYAYH
```
Earlier, `background_output` had already warned the task was "owned by a different runtime
than the one serving this tool call".

**Root cause:** task records live in the runtime's memory and do not survive a restart.

**Workaround:** dispatch a fresh agent pointed at the existing worktree, with an explicit
"here is what is already on disk" briefing. Cheap, because the work itself is on disk —
only the reasoning is lost. This is a strong argument for instructing lanes to **commit
early** rather than batching everything behind one final commit.

**Fix status:** unfixed — persisting task records across restarts would close it.

## 2026-08-17 — Completion summary replays every historical park as a current failure

**Severity:** costly
**Area:** background tasks
**Observed in:** `~/git/onara`, wave of 3 parallel lanes

**What happened:** the final "all background tasks finished" summary reported
**`14 FAILED`** for a wave of **three** lanes. The list was not fourteen distinct
failures — it was the same two task ids repeated, one line per *historical* park or error
across each task's whole lifetime, most of them tagged `[RUNNING]`. Two of the entries were
verbatim replays of block reasons that had already been resolved and superseded an hour
earlier.

Read literally, the summary says most of the wave failed. On disk, one lane was fully
committed and clean, and the other two had complete work awaiting a commit. Nothing had
failed.

**Evidence:**
```
[ALL BACKGROUND TASKS FINISHED - 14 FAILED]
Completed:
- bg_3db0b708 … | bg_524a0301 … | bg_85e1ba37 …
Failed:
- bg_3db0b708 … [RUNNING]
- bg_3db0b708 … [RUNNING]
- bg_85e1ba37 … [RUNNING]
   (× 14, only two distinct ids, several tagged [RUNNING], two replaying stale
    block reasons already resolved)
```
Disk at the same moment: lane 23 `c701b35e0`, 0 dirty; lane 20 and 21 complete but
uncommitted.

**Root cause / hypothesis:** the summary appears to aggregate every park/error event ever
recorded for a task rather than its terminal state, and does not dedupe by task id. The
`[RUNNING]` tag on lines under a `Failed:` heading suggests state is being read from event
history, not from the task's final status.

**Workaround:** ignore the counts entirely; verify each lane from disk —
`git log --oneline -1`, `git status --porcelain`, and test-result timestamps. This is the
same rule that applies to the dead-task-reports-`running` finding above: **disk is the only
trustworthy status.**

**Fix status:** unfixed. Dedupe by task id and report only terminal state; a task that
parked and later succeeded is a success.

## 2026-08-17 — `report_blocked` used for waiting, not for blocking

**Severity:** costly
**Area:** subagents
**Observed in:** `~/git/onara`, across ~8 lanes

**What happened:** subagents repeatedly parked via `report_blocked` on situations that
required no parent decision at all — most often a long-running gradle job **they had
started themselves** that was either still alive or had already finished successfully. One
lane parked twice this way; each park cost a full round-trip. In one case the agent had a
completely green board (`detekt` `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, `.rc` = 0, no gradle process alive)
and parked anyway rather than reading it.

The same mechanism was also used correctly and valuably: a different lane parked four
times and every one was a genuine defect needing my decision (a repository signature that
could not express its own acceptance criteria, a missing Flyway migration, a missing pgen
enum entry, a dead enum constant). So the tool works; the calibration of *when* to use it
does not.

**Evidence:** representative false park —
```
Blocked: Final detekt process remains active after tool timeout;
         source/evidence edits uncommitted.
Needs from parent: Resume lane after detekt completes.
```
State at that moment: `/tmp/j23-detekt-final.log` → `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 25s`,
`/tmp/j23-final.rc` → `0`, `pgrep -f gradlew` → nothing running.

**Root cause / hypothesis:** the `report_blocked` tool description says to use it "if
blocked and parent input is required", but gives no test for distinguishing *blocked* from
*waiting*. A slow job that outlives a tool timeout reads to the agent as an external
condition it cannot resolve. Compounded by the detached-job finding above: an agent that
cannot be woken by its own job has no other move it trusts.

**Workaround:** state the distinction explicitly in the lane prompt — *waiting is not
blocking* — plus the three concrete checks to run before parking: `pgrep -f gradlew`,
`cat /tmp/<job>.rc`, `tail` the log. Park only for something the parent alone can decide:
an ambiguous spec, a missing API, a cross-lane conflict.

**Fix status:** worked around per-prompt. A durable fix would put the waiting-vs-blocking
test into the `report_blocked` tool description itself, so it applies without every parent
re-teaching it.
